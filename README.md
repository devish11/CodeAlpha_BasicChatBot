## 🧠 Task 4 – Basic Chatbot
## 🎯 Goal

To build a simple rule-based chatbot using only basic Python concepts.

## 💡 Overview

This chatbot interacts with the user through predefined responses.
It understands basic inputs like "hello", "how are you", and "bye", and replies accordingly.
The project focuses on fundamental logic building without using any external libraries.

## 🧩 Key Concepts Used

if-elif statements for conditional responses

Functions to organize chatbot logic

Loops to keep the conversation active

Input/Output for user interaction

## ⚙️ How It Works

The chatbot starts with a greeting.

It continuously takes user input.

Based on the input, it gives a predefined response.

The chat ends when the user types "bye".

## 🐍 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: None (Core Python only)

## 💬 Example Interaction
```bash
You: hello  
Bot: Hi!  

You: how are you  
Bot: I'm fine, thanks!  

You: bye  
Bot: Goodbye!
```
## 🏁 Conclusion

A minimalistic chatbot built purely with basic Python logic, demonstrating how simple constructs like conditions, loops, and functions can bring interactivity to console-based programs.
